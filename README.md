<h2>Data Pipeline: CSV -> Python -> Tableau -> Server</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CSV as dasta extracts from different systems.</li>
  <li>Python from ETL (extract, transform, load).</li>
  <li>Tableau for data visualization dasboards.</li>
  <li>Server to get dasboard published for stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demo with conculstions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this case I use static source  which is CSV flat files (batch processing).</li>
  <li>However data pipelines are built also for real-time sources where target system requires constant data update (stream processing).</li>
  <li>The example show that ultimate destination of data pipelines doesn't have to be a data warehouse.</li>
  <li>Data pipeline can route the processed data into another applications like Tableu for building dashboards.</li>
</ul>
